This example demonstrates using the DFRobot ESP32-S3 AI Camera to take timed photos and save them to an SD card. The default photo interval is set to 25 seconds, which can be modified by adjusting the `TIME_TO_SLEEP` parameter. The LED will turn on when taking photos, and the ESP32-S3 will enter sleep mode after each photo is captured.
